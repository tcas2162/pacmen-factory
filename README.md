# pacmen-factory
  For this factory exercise, I created an array that stores PacMen and         generates them on the screen with the click of a button. They freely         move around the page, each at their own pace. Each time a PacMan is         created, that action pushes it on to the end of the array. The images         are positioned in the DOM, essentially a mirror in the code of what is occurring in the DOM.
