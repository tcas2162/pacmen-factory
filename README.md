# pacmen-factory

For this factory exercise, I created an array that stores PacMen and generates them on the screen with the click of a button. They freely move around the page, each at their own pace. Each time a PacMan is created, that action pushes it on to the end of the array. The images are positioned in the DOM, essentially a mirror in the code of what is occurring in the DOM.

There are no dependencies that need to be installed to run this program.
When you click on the page, you will see a blank page, save for two
buttons that say "Add PacMan" and "Start Game." Clicking "Start Game
will start the movement of the PacMen around the page. A limitless
number of PacMen can be added before or during the game. They all move
at random velocities in random directions throughout the page. Collision
detection is enabled both horizontally and vertically, preventing the
Pacmen from going off-screen and helping each one to retain control of
its position and velocity. The PacMen are generated with an image tag
and added to the DOM.
